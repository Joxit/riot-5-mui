# riot-mui
##Welcome!
[Riot JS](http://riotjs.com/) is tiniest (by size) library allowing to create user interfaces. Riot is robust, fast and has enjoyable syntax. Unfortunately Riot doesn't have library of material UI components. This project aims to fix this problem.

Any person who loves Riot and material UI willing to be a part of this project - welcome! We have great chance to create set of components which will provide basic features of [Material UI](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) for Riot.
